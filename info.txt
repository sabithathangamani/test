Hello world!!

A language that was originally designed to build dynamic web pages may now be run on the server and on almost any device that has the JavaScript Engine installed.

After HTML and CSS, JavaScript is the third biggest web technology. JavaScript is a scripting language that may be used to construct online and mobile apps, web servers, games, and more. JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that is used to generate websites and applications. It was created with the intention of being used in a browser. Even today, the server-side version of JavaScript known as Node.js may be used to create online and mobile apps, real-time applications, online streaming applications, and videogames. Javascript frameworks, often known as inbuilt libraries, may be used to construct desktop and mobile programs. Developers may save a lot of time on monotonous programming jobs by using these code libraries, allowing them to focus on the production work of development.
